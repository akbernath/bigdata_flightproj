Q: Are there any airlines that have shown consistent improvement in delays, across the entire country, over the 25 years of flight data?

	Recorder - Ethan 
	Checker - Heather
	Monitor - Andrew
	Coordinator – All three


Tasks:
	Andrew:
		-Set up new github (done!)
	Ethan:
		-Set up google group again (asap; Wednesday problem!)
	Heather:
		-Look some at data for stratification
	All:
		-Play around some with SQL stuff?

-How should we aggregate the entire country?
	-Stratify?
		-Different cities
		-Airlines
	-Central hubs have exacerbated delays; account for in weights

Figure out method to stratify groups (improves precision)
	-Proportion-based sample?
Get point estimates + error for each (airline, year)
	-Start with one?
Render appropriately, look for “consistent improvement”
