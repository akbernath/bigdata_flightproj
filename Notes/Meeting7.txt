Meeting 7

Discussion of Presentation
	4 sections
		I. QOI & Methods
			Choosing a metric
				Mention second metric (briefly), but go with arrival delay
				Mention keeping negative times
			Narrowing Scope
				Ran all airlines and years
				Only kept airlines with 10+ years consecutive active
			Yearly avgs. vs. motnhs
		II. Population Findings
			Really fast! Originally worried it was running wrong
		III. Sampling Findings
			Bias Histogram
				Sample mean plot with SEs + pop means
			Stratification Methods
				Initial choice: 380 airports, unreasonable computation
				Moved to Sm/Med/Large
				We think size classes will have smaller delays
		IV. Obstacles & Discussions
			Metric for delay in airlines
				Original thoughts: changeable
					Started in 2003?
					Jump from 2007-2008?
