-heather's sampling code works!
	-4.5 hour runtime
-using two metrics?
-possible options for graphical display
	-each airline individually; show interesting ones?
	-show major airlines (all 25 years)?
	-find bias between sampled tables and pop. tables
		-show histogram of overall bias
-GRAPHICAL INTERPRETATION:
	-delta is clear winner in arrival delay (consistently decreasing)
	-alaska was also decent
	-to check: XE and WN
	-difference in means graph
	
to-do:
	-run heather's code, swap arrdelay for carrierdelay+lateaircraftdelay
	-tex up meeting notes
	-set up file interpretation

	
to-do (andrew):
	-graphical displays
	-write/arrange paper
	
to-do (heather):
