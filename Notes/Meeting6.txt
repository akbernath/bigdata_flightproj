Heather's data is biased; what do we do?
	Actually not terribly so; +0.6 minutes for AA
Population data has HUGE sd!!
Carrierdelay and lateaircraftdelay NOT VIABLE
	2007-->2008 has a huge jump for all but weatherdelay!



Andrew:
	1. Finish outline
	2. Graphics?
	
Ethan
	1. Organize *all* arrival means/sd into one aggregate data set
		Rows: by year
		Columns: by	
			*carrier*.pop_mu
			*carrier*.pop_sd
			*carrier*.smp_mu
			*carrier*.smp_sd
				
	2. Edit population code 
		- Comment out test code for now
		- Add Heather's graphs and medians
